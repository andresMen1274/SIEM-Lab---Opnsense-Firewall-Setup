# SIEM-Lab---Opnsense-Firewall-Setup
This is a project in which I set up a virtual environment using a Wide Area Network(WAN) and Local Area Network(LAN) and simulate a network connection between them. Furthermore, I configure a firewall between this connection and follow security procedures.

After downloading Virtual Box and Kali Linux I configure a Wide Area Network(WAN) and Local Area Network(LAN) and simulate a network connection between them. Network Adapter one is used to simulate the WAN connection. Then adapater two is used to simulate a LAN connection.

Using the downloaded Opnsense file we will start the virtual machine with this disk file.

Using the defalut username installer and password opnsense. We are able to open the opnsense download menu.

After successfully downloading the firewall we remove the firewall disk and reboot the system. We will now login as a root user and assign the interfaces em0 will serve as the WAN interface and em1 will serve as the LAN interface. I will not configure the IP address as defalut one is given.

Next we will boot up kali linux and ping to the LAN interface to check that the connection was configured correctly.

Then I will open the web browser and look up the defalut IP that was given and login to opnsense and check the status of the system. Then I go to firmware and check the status of the system and give updates to the system.

This concludes the first part of the OPNsense firewall configuration for Virtual Box.
