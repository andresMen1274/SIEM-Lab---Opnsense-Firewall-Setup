# SIEM-Lab---Opnsense-Firewall-Setup
This is a project in which I set up a virtual environment using a Wide Area Network(WAN) and Local Area Network(LAN) and simulate a network connection between them. Furthermore, I configure a firewall between this connection and follow security procedures.

After downloading Virtual Box and Kali Linux I configure a Wide Area Network(WAN) and Local Area Network(LAN) and simulate a network connection between them. Network Adapter one is used to simulate the WAN connection. Then adapater two is used to simulate a LAN connection.
